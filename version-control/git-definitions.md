# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

version control is..


* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows developers to save multiple versions of the project they're working on for later access.
This is useful because it allows developers to reset to a certain stage of their project, aswell as allowing them to look back at what is causing the problem.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is made in git as a new line of development to work on a specific feature/bug of the project.  Making branches is done so that the main code(master) remains pure/untouched and to make sure that no unstable code is merged to the main code(master)

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point of the project at a certain stage.  Good commit messages are specific in describing what modifications have been made since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when developers edit the same parts of the same files on their respective branches and try to merge them.  Because the changes were in the same place, git doesn't know which changes to use and needs help :/
