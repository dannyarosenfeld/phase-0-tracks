<strong>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</strong>
<p>To help disabled people navigate the page and to make the page more readable.  I learned that the main tag is especially helpful in letting people see important info that is the meat of the page.  the nav tag and article tag seem useful in really helping users navigate easily through the html</p>

<strong>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</strong>

<p>It renders the DOM from top to bottom</p>

<strong>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</strong>

<p>I learned that I can create snippets for specific file types.  Sure, it seems really useful</p>

<strong>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept?</strong>
<p>The order of semantic elements.  What should be a child of what, and what order should the elements go in.  I can search on google to enhance my understanding  </p>
