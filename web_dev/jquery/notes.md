1. I plan on watching videos of people manipulating the DOM with jquery.

2. I really love things like codepen and js fiddle being able to see how jquery makes the page
more interactive visually will help me.

3. Maybe I'll watch a youtube video or two for a rundown

4. Install bower to easily attach jquery to my site.

5. then I'll experiment some myself by trying to write my own versions of other people's code

6. I'll try to take a 10 minute break every hour
